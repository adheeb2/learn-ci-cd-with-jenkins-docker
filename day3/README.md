# Day 3: Automating Jenkins Builds with Ngrok, GitHub Webhooks & Jenkinsfile

Today we will learn how to write **JenkinsFile** and **automate Jenkins builds** using **Ngrok** and **GitHub Webhooks**, instead of manually clicking “Build Now”.
By the end, you’ll understand how Ngrok exposes your local Jenkins, how GitHub webhooks notify Jenkins, and how Jenkinsfile defines your pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins running locally (see Day 1 setup with Docker)

- A GitHub repository connected to Jenkins

- Ngrok installed and configured

- A basic Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline created (see Day 2)
